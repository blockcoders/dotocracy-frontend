  "low_voter_turnout": "Low voter turnout",
  "low_voter_turnout_text": "In many cases, under an optimistic scenario, the participation of only 60% of the electoral roll or qualified voters is expected. This is a very low participation rate, which can be increased by the use of a reliable and secure voting system that allows voters to vote from any location and device in which they can give proof of identity.",

  "high_costs_and_exorbitant_times_text": "As the system is currently implemented, it is very expensive and it takes a lot of time to count the votes. This is a problem that can be solved by using a blockchain-based voting system. It is not only a matter of time and money, but also of security. As more time pases between the voting and the results, the more unseccure the results are. This is because the results can be manipulated.",

It is a decentralized and secure system that allows voters to vote from any location and device in which they can give proof of identity.

  "vote_counting_faster_and_cheaper_text": "Using Dotocracy, the vote counting procedure is faster and cheaper. This is because every vote is counted in real time and the results are immutable. This means that the results are available as soon as the voting is closed and they can not be tampered.",
  "why_polkadot": "Why Polkadot?",
  "why_polkadot_text": "Polkadot is a Substrate-based blockchain that allows the creation of multiple parachains to be connected to the main chain. Substrate is a framework that allows the creation of blockchains using a modular approach. It uses Rust programming language and it is very secure. It is also very fast and scalable. Fees in polkadot are very low and the TPS is very high. This makes it a perfect environment to be used as a base for a voting system.",
  "moonbeam": "Moonbeam",
  "moonbeam_text": "Is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot. This means that contracts are written in Solidity and they can be deployed to the Moonbeam network. This is a very important feature because it allows the use of existing smart contracts to be used in the Dotocracy voting system.",
  "astar": "Astar",
  "astar_text": "The network supports the building of dApps with EVM and WASM smart contracts and offers developers true interoperability, with cross-consensus messaging (XCM). Astar Network focuses on making the best smart contract platform so that dApps developers on Polkadot do not need to pay much attention to infrastructure and can focus more on their dApp.",

This will potentially be done by an strategy that consists of generating a new wallet for every voter without them knowing it. This wallet will be used to sign the vote after the user give their proof of identity."
